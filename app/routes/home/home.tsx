        <p>I built this portfolio website in 2016 to land a position as a web developer. Then, in 2020, I made minor updates to the landing page and linked a new CV (now removed). I didn't take the time to modernise the stack, so it remained a time capsule of 2016 web development trends: Angular 1, Gulp, and Bower.</p>
        <p>Now in 2025 we have AI, and I was curious about how quickly I could update the stack with our new developer tools. Because a <a href="https://github.com/melaniebrgr/learning-computer-science/blob/main/00-everyweeks/2025/week32.md">sequential migration became untenable</a>, the approach was to start from a fresh React Router installation and then use AI to sequentially migrate pages. With some back and forth with claude-4-sonnet in Cursor, I succeeded in migrating the site to React, React Router, and Vite in a day.</p>
        <p>So the content may be old, but the stack is fresh, and because a GitHub Action now automatically deploys the site to AWS, making frequent content updates is viable.</p>
        <p>I am currently the frontend lead on an AI-assisted learning platform at a EdTech in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.</p>
        <p className="date">May 10, 2020</p>
        <p>A few changes since my last update. This website was original built with Gulp, Angular 1 and Sass, and rebooting it after 3 years of working in React was both nostaligic and painful. I have a new appreciation for component driven development and perspective on the cascading part of CSS.</p>
        <p>Currently I'm a front-end developer at Rangle.io. I work on React and React Native projects from medical devices to e-commerce sites. I am interested in understanding how to create "pits of success" architecture that lead to robust and maintainable code. Over the past couple years I've also instructed and mentored for Bridgeschool.io a non-for-profit that skills up women breaking into tech. I currently live in Amsterdam, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.</p>
        <p className="date">Aug 29, 2016</p>
        <p>Welcome my portfolio website. I enjoy creating at the intersection of art, science, and technology, and organizing community events on behalf of the <a href="https://www.bmcaa.com/" target="_blank">BMCAA</a>. I live in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.</p>
