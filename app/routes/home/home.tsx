        <p>I built this portfolio website in 2016 at the conclusion of a bootcamp to help land a position as a web developer. Then, in 2020, I made minor updates this landing page content and linked an updated CV. I didn't take the time to modernise the stack, so my personal site remained a time capsule of 2016 web development trends: Angular 1, gulp, and bower.</p>
        <p>Now in 2025, we have AI, and I wanted to see if I could update the stack quickly and conveniently the latest tools. The approach was to start from a fresh react router installation and then use AI to sequentially migrate pages. With some back a forth with claude-4-sonnet in Cursor, I succeeded in a day to migrate the site to React, React Router, and Vite.</p>
        <p>I currently work at an EdTech as a frontend lead on an AI assisted learning platform.</p>
        <h4 className="date">May 10, 2020</h4>
        <p>A few changes since my last update. This website was original built with gulp, angular 1 and sass, and rebooting it after 3 years of working in React was nostaligic. I have a new appreciation for component driven development and perspective on the CSS style cascade andt theÂ§ maintainability of gobal styles.</p>
        <p>Currently I'm a front-end developer at Rangle.io. I work on React and React Native projects from medical devices to e-commerce sites. I am interested in understanding how to create "pits of success" architecture that lead to robust and maintainable code. Over the past couple years I've also instructed and mentored for Bridgeschool.io a non-for-profit that skills up women breaking into tech. I currently live in Amsterdam, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.</p>
        <h4 className="date">Aug 29, 2016</h4>
